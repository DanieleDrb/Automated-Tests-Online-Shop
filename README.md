# Automation Testing with Playwright and JavaScript

## Overview
This repository contains an automation testing project where I practiced my skills using Playwright and JavaScript. The project involves creating and executing comprehensive test cases for the Automation Exercise website, covering functionalities such as user registration, placing orders, submitting reviews, and downloading invoices. The project leverages the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure scalability and maintainability of the test code.

## Project Structure
# Pages Directory
This directory contains JavaScript files representing different pages of the application. Each file includes locators and methods specific to that page.

# Tests Directory
This directory contains JavaScript files for different test scenarios. Each file includes test cases that validate the functionalities of the corresponding pages.

## Key Features
- Page Object Model (POM): Implemented POM to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication. Each page object encapsulates the elements and actions specific to a page.
- Comprehensive Test Coverage: Developed test cases to cover critical user flows including registration, login, product search, adding to cart, placing orders, reviewing products, and downloading invoices.
- Playwright Framework: Leveraged Playwright for its robust and reliable end-to-end testing capabilities, including handling multiple browser contexts, intercepting network requests, and automating user interactions.
- JavaScript Proficiency: Enhanced my JavaScript skills by writing modular and reusable code, adhering to best practices for readability and maintainability.
- Ortoni-Report Integration: Utilized Ortoni-Report to generate detailed and visually appealing test reports, providing clear insights into test execution and results.

## How It Works
1. Setup and Configuration: The project setup includes installing Playwright and configuring it for testing.
2. Page Objects: Each page object file defines the locators and methods for interacting with the page elements.
3. Test Cases: The test files import page objects and use them to write test scenarios. Each test validates a specific functionality of the application.
4. Running Tests: Tests are executed using Playwrightâ€™s test runner, and results are reported for each scenario.

## Technologies Used
- Playwright
- JavaScript
- Page Object Model (POM)
- HTML/CSS (for understanding the webpage structure)
- Ortoni-Report
